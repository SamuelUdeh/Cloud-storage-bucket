Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

In this project you will learn how to create a storage bucket, upload objects to it, create folders and subfolders in it, and make objects publicly accessible using the Google Cloud command line.
